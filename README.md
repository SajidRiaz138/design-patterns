## Creational Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Pros:**
- Controlled access to the single instance.
- Reduced namespace pollution.
- Permits refinement of operations and representation.

**Cons:**
- Can be difficult to unit test.
- Can introduce global state into an application.

**Object-Oriented Principles:**
- **Encapsulation:** Ensures a single instance with a global access point.
- **Coupling:** Can lead to tightly coupled code due to the global state.
- **Cohesion:** High cohesion within the singleton instance.

### Factory Method Pattern
The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Pros:**
- Provides hooks for subclasses.

**Cons:**
- Can complicate the code by requiring a hierarchy of Factory classes.

**Object-Oriented Principles:**
- **Open/Closed Principle:** Easy to extend with new product types without changing the client code.
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** The factory is responsible for creating objects, while the objects themselves are responsible for their own behavior.

### Abstract Factory Pattern
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Pros:**
- Ensures consistency among products.
